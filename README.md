## Prompts

This application was built using the following prompts to generate the content structure and code:

### Content Model Prompt

> Project Name: ShelfScout
> 
> Goal:
> Launch a polished web app where users upload a photo of their bookshelf or paste a few titles. The Cosmic AI Agent extracts owned books, normalizes metadata, infers reading preferences, and returns three new book recommendations with short reasons. Each pick links to Amazon with the configured Associates tag. Mobile first. Fast. Delightful.
> 
> Primary Principle:
> Cosmic AI is the agent. All AI steps run through a single Cosmic AI Agent with tool access. The web app only coordinates user input, displays results, and stores structured content in Cosmic.

### Code Generation Prompt

> Based on the content model I created for the ShelfScout project, now build a complete web application that showcases this content. Include a modern, responsive design with proper navigation, content display, and user-friendly interface.

The app has been tailored to work with your existing Cosmic content structure and includes all the features requested above.
